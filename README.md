### What is DevOps?
- The DevOps is a combination of two words, one is software Development, and second is Operations. This allows a single team to handle the entire application lifecycle, from development to testing, deployment, and operations. DevOps helps you to reduce the disconnection between software developers, quality assurance (QA) engineers, and system administrators.

### What are the benifits of DevOps?

- DevOps is an excellent approach for quick development and deployment of applications.
- It responds faster to the market changes to improve business growth.
- DevOps escalate business profit by decreasing software delivery time and transportation costs.
- DevOps clears the descriptive process, which gives clarity on product development and delivery.
- It improves customer experience and satisfaction.
- DevOps simplifies collaboration and places all tools in the cloud for customers to access.
- DevOps means collective responsibility, which leads to better team engagement and productivity.

### What is OOP?
- Object means a real-world entity such as a pen, chair, table, computer, watch, etc. Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects. It simplifies software development and maintenance by providing some concepts:

  - Object
  - Class
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism
  - Abstraction
  - Encapsulation
  
 ### What are the benefits of OOPS?
 -  OOPs makes development and maintenance easier, whereas, in a procedure-oriented programming language, it is not easy to manage if code grows as project size increases.

- OOPs provides data hiding, whereas, in a procedure-oriented programming language, global data can be accessed from anywhere.
- OOPs provides the ability to simulate real-world event much more effectively. We can provide the solution of real word problem if we are using the Object-Oriented Programming language.

### Why is python used in DevOps?
- Python is a popular high-level and general-purpose programming language. It is most often used as a ‘scripting language’ for web applications and programs. Currently it is one of the most widely used languages in the IT industry.

- Due to its range of benefits it was obvious for it to be adopted into the workings of the DevOps cycle.
- Although many scripting languages are used, Python is most widely and extensively used language.

- Python is versatile and programming friendly with vast libraries makes Automation easy and smooth. Hence is has extensive use in DevOps and has become the de facto language for Automation of DevOps

### Have you done any scripting before?
- we have used boto3 for scripting the CRUD operations of S3
- Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3 and Amazon EC2. 

### What is virtualisation?
- Virtualization is the "creation of a virtual (rather than actual) version of something, such as a server, a desktop, a storage device, an operating system or network resources".

- In other words, Virtualization is a technique, which allows to share a single physical instance of a resource or an application among multiple customers and organizations. It does by assigning a logical name to a physical storage and providing a pointer to that physical resource when demanded.

### What is Git/Github?
- Git is an open-source distributed version control system. It is designed to handle minor to major projects with high speed and efficiency. It is developed to co-ordinate the work among the developers. The version control allows us to track and work together with our team members at the same workspace.

### What is the difference between security group and a NACL?
- It adds a security layer to EC2 instances that control both inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level.

- NACL also adds an additional layer of security associated with subnets that control both inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level.

### What is a VPC?
- VPC stands for Virtual Private Cloud.
- Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) provides a logically isolated area of the AWS cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define.
- You have complete control over your virtual networking environment, including a selection of your IP address range, the creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways.
- You can easily customize the network configuration for your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud. For example, you can create a public-facing subnet for web servers that can access to the internet and can also place your backend system such as databases or application servers to a private-facing subnet.
- You can provide multiple layers of security, including security groups and network access control lists, to help control access to Amazon EC2 instances in each subnet.

### How did you make sure your app was secure on AWS?
- By providing layers of security ,the security groups to EC2, by placing the EC2 in the VPC and in the public subnet and by giving the key(eng130.pem)

### What is CI/CD?
- Continuous integration is a coding philosophy and set of practices that drive development teams to frequently implement small code changes and check them in to a version control repository. Most modern applications require developing code using a variety of platforms and tools, so teams need a consistent mechanism to integrate and validate changes. Continuous integration establishes an automated way to build, package, and test their applications. Having a consistent integration process encourages developers to commit code changes more frequently, which leads to better collaboration and code quality.

- Continuous delivery picks up where continuous integration ends, and automates application delivery to selected environments, including production, development, and testing environments. Continuous delivery is an automated way to push code changes to these environments.
