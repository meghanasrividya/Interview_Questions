### What is DevOps?
- The DevOps is a combination of two words, one is software Development, and second is Operations. This allows a single team to handle the entire application lifecycle, from development to testing, deployment, and operations. DevOps helps you to reduce the disconnection between software developers, quality assurance (QA) engineers, and system administrators.

### What are the benefits of DevOps?

- DevOps is an excellent approach for quick development and deployment of applications.
- It responds faster to the market changes to improve business growth.
- DevOps escalate business profit by decreasing software delivery time and transportation costs.
- DevOps clears the descriptive process, which gives clarity on product development and delivery.
- It improves customer experience and satisfaction.
- DevOps simplifies collaboration and places all tools in the cloud for customers to access.
- DevOps means collective responsibility, which leads to better team engagement and productivity.

### What is OOP?
- Object means a real-world entity such as a pen, chair, table, computer, watch, etc. Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects. It simplifies software development and maintenance by providing some concepts:

  - Object
  - Class
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism
  - Abstraction
  - Encapsulation
  
 ### What are the benefits of OOPS?
 -  OOPs makes development and maintenance easier, whereas, in a procedure-oriented programming language, it is not easy to manage if code grows as project size increases.

- OOPs provides data hiding, whereas, in a procedure-oriented programming language, global data can be accessed from anywhere.
- OOPs provides the ability to simulate real-world event much more effectively. We can provide the solution of real word problem if we are using the Object-Oriented Programming language.

### Why is python used in DevOps?
- Python is a popular high-level and general-purpose programming language. It is most often used as a ‘scripting language’ for web applications and programs. Currently it is one of the most widely used languages in the IT industry.

- Due to its range of benefits it was obvious for it to be adopted into the workings of the DevOps cycle.
- Although many scripting languages are used, Python is most widely and extensively used language.

- Python is versatile and programming friendly with vast libraries makes Automation easy and smooth. Hence is has extensive use in DevOps and has become the de facto language for Automation of DevOps

### Have you done any scripting before?
- we have used boto3 for scripting the CRUD operations of S3
- Boto3 is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Software Development Kit (SDK) for Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon S3 and Amazon EC2. 

### What is virtualisation?
- Virtualization is the "creation of a virtual (rather than actual) version of something, such as a server, a desktop, a storage device, an operating system or network resources".

- In other words, Virtualization is a technique, which allows to share a single physical instance of a resource or an application among multiple customers and organizations. It does by assigning a logical name to a physical storage and providing a pointer to that physical resource when demanded.

### What is Git/Github?
- Git is an open-source distributed version control system. It is designed to handle minor to major projects with high speed and efficiency. It is developed to co-ordinate the work among the developers. The version control allows us to track and work together with our team members at the same workspace.

### What is the difference between security group and a NACL?
- It adds a security layer to EC2 instances that control both inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level.

- NACL also adds an additional layer of security associated with subnets that control both inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level.

### What is a VPC?
- VPC stands for Virtual Private Cloud.
- Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) provides a logically isolated area of the AWS cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define.
- You have complete control over your virtual networking environment, including a selection of your IP address range, the creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways.
- You can easily customize the network configuration for your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud. For example, you can create a public-facing subnet for web servers that can access to the internet and can also place your backend system such as databases or application servers to a private-facing subnet.
- You can provide multiple layers of security, including security groups and network access control lists, to help control access to Amazon EC2 instances in each subnet.

### How did you make sure your app was secure on AWS?
- By providing layers of security ,the security groups to EC2, by placing the EC2 in the VPC and in the public subnet and by giving the key(eng130.pem)

### What is CI/CD?
- Continuous integration is a coding philosophy and set of practices that drive development teams to frequently implement small code changes and check them in to a version control repository. Most modern applications require developing code using a variety of platforms and tools, so teams need a consistent mechanism to integrate and validate changes. Continuous integration establishes an automated way to build, package, and test their applications. Having a consistent integration process encourages developers to commit code changes more frequently, which leads to better collaboration and code quality.

- Continuous delivery picks up where continuous integration ends, and automates application delivery to selected environments, including production, development, and testing environments. Continuous delivery is an automated way to push code changes to these environments.

### What is the difference between monolith and 2 tier architecture?

- In Monolith architecture, the whole application works only as a single layer. A layer is a group of objects. Smaller applications are usually written this way. The monolithic architecture is rather an antipattern and we shouldn't use it for larger applications.

- In the two-tier architecture, applications on the client end can directly communicate with the database at the server side. 
   - The user interfaces and application programs are run on the client-side.
   - The server side is responsible to provide the functionalities like: query processing and transaction management.
   - To communicate with the DBMS, client-side application establishes a connection with the server side.
   
### What is pull request?

- A pull request – also referred to as a merge request – is an event that takes place in software development when a contributor/developer is ready to begin the process of merging new code changes with the main project repository.

### What is Docker and Docker compose file?
- Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications.

- Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application's services.
## Soft Skills Questions

### How do you handle stress?
- I actually prefer to work under stressful or pressurised conditions because this is when I am at my best. I handle stress and pressure by focusing on the task in hand, by remaining calm and by creating lists what needs to be done and in what order.I also handle pressure by making sure I keep myself fit and healthy.I eat well and do meditation and exercise. By doing these things it enables me to maintain optimum concentration levels whilst at work.

### Why DevOps?

- I worked as IT Helpdesk co-ordinator for 5 years where I had to do job of system administrator we had to the updates manually on regular basis.
- Using DeVOps we can automate the work that a system administrator do. So I wanted to learn the DevOps skills and become DevOps Engineer.

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years of time?
- In 5 years of time , I still wanted to work for sparta global as permanent employee having gained advancement in the role.
- I wanted to gain proficiency in the technical skills.
- As I enjoy learning a  lot I wanted to do many certifications which help me to progress in my role.
- I will be positive and determined towards achieving my goals as well as company goals
- I will be comitted and determined to my profession and deliver the best while learning from the best.
