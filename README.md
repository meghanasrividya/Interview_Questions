### What is DevOps?
- The DevOps is a combination of two words, one is software Development, and second is Operations. This allows a single team to handle the entire application lifecycle, from development to testing, deployment, and operations. DevOps helps you to reduce the disconnection between software developers, quality assurance (QA) engineers, and system administrators.

### What are the benifits of DevOps?

- DevOps is an excellent approach for quick development and deployment of applications.
- It responds faster to the market changes to improve business growth.
- DevOps escalate business profit by decreasing software delivery time and transportation costs.
- DevOps clears the descriptive process, which gives clarity on product development and delivery.
- It improves customer experience and satisfaction.
- DevOps simplifies collaboration and places all tools in the cloud for customers to access.
- DevOps means collective responsibility, which leads to better team engagement and productivity.

### What is OOP?
- Object means a real-world entity such as a pen, chair, table, computer, watch, etc. Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects. It simplifies software development and maintenance by providing some concepts:

  - Object
  - Class
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism
  - Abstraction
  - Encapsulation
  
 ### What are the benefits of OOPS?
 -  OOPs makes development and maintenance easier, whereas, in a procedure-oriented programming language, it is not easy to manage if code grows as project size increases.

- OOPs provides data hiding, whereas, in a procedure-oriented programming language, global data can be accessed from anywhere.
- OOPs provides the ability to simulate real-world event much more effectively. We can provide the solution of real word problem if we are using the Object-Oriented Programming language.

### Why is python used in DevOps?
- Python is a popular high-level and general-purpose programming language. It is most often used as a ‘scripting language’ for web applications and programs. Currently it is one of the most widely used languages in the IT industry.

- Due to its range of benefits it was obvious for it to be adopted into the workings of the DevOps cycle.
- Although many scripting languages are used, Python is most widely and extensively used language.

- Python is versatile and programming friendly with vast libraries makes Automation easy and smooth. Hence is has extensive use in DevOps and has become the de facto language for Automation of DevOps
